            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Hi, I'm Eve,</h3>
            <p>My passion for design and technology has driven me to excel both inside and outside the classroom. 
                As an active member of Drexel's academic community, I've engaged with various student organizations that
                align with my interests and career goals. I've been a dedicated member of the Women in Computing Society,
                where I've contributed to fostering diversity and empowerment in the tech industry. Additionally, my
                involvement in the CHI User Experience Club has allowed me to explore and refine my skills in creating
                meaningful user experiences. As a member of the Drexel CyberDragons, I've had the opportunity to delve into
                the exciting world of cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>My skill set encompasses a wide range of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python,
                SQL, and PHP. I'm proficient in utilizing various design and development tools such as the Adobe Suite, Git,
                Visual Studio, Figma, InVision, and WordPress.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and design, and I'm eager to continue pushing the
                boundaries of what's possible in the world of information systems and design. Feel free to explore my
                portfolio to get a glimpse of the work I've created and the skills I bring to the table. I'm excited about
                the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to contributing my expertise to innovative and impactful
                projects in the future.</p>
